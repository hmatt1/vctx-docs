## Why vctx?

vctx is a modern Hardware Description Language (HDL) designed to make digital logic design safer, clearer, and more productive. By enforcing structural thinking and explicit timing, it eliminates entire classes of bugs common in legacy HDLs.

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Explicit Timing" icon="time">
		Never confuse combinational and sequential logic again.
        `:=` for immediate connections.
        `<=` for clocked updates.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Implicit Clock & Reset" icon="setting">
		Stop wiring `clk` and `rst` everywhere. vctx handles the standard synchronous model for you, keeping your code clean and focused on logic.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Built on CIRCT" icon="rocket">
		Leverages the power of LLVM and MLIR via the CIRCT project. Compiles to clean SystemVerilog for synthesis or optimized machine code for simulation.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Formal Verification" icon="magnifier">
		First-class support for formal methods. Use `sym`, `assume`, and `assert` to mathematically prove your design is correct.
	</Card>

## A Taste of vctx

Here is a complete "Blinky" example. Note the clear distinction between the register definition, the sequential update, and the combinational output.

```vctx
component Blinky(output led: u1) {
    // A 27-bit register initialized to 0
    reg counter: u27 = 0

    // Sequential update (implicitly uses global clk & rst)
    counter <= counter + 1

    // Combinational connection
    led := counter[24]
}
```
