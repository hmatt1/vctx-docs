## Why vctx?

vctx is a Hardware Description Language (HDL) designed with modern language features and a fast development lifecycle.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Explicit Timing" icon="time">
    Clear distinction between combinational and sequential logic.
    `:=` for wires.
    `<=` for clocked updates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built on CIRCT" icon="rocket">
    Leverages the power of LLVM and MLIR via the CIRCT project. Compiles to clean SystemVerilog for synthesis and runs simulation with the CIRCT `arc` dialect.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Formal Verification" icon="magnifier">
    First-class support for formal methods. Use `sym`, `assume`, and `assert` to mathematically prove your design is correct.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## A Taste of vctx

Here is a complete "Blinky" example.

```vctx
component Blinky(output led: u1) {
    // A 27-bit register initialized to 0
    reg counter: u27 = 0

    // Sequential update (implicitly uses global clk & rst)
    counter <= counter + 1

    // Combinational connection
    led := counter[24]
}

```
