## Installation

(todo)

## Initialize a New Project

```bash
# Create a new vctx project in the current directory
vctx init

## Create a file

Copy paste this into a file named `blinky.vctx`

```vctx
(todo)
```

## Run the tests

```
vctx check

vctx test

vctx sim --vcd
```

## View the generated waveform
