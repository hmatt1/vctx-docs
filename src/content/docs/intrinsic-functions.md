title: Intrinsic Functions
description: Built-in helpers like assert, assume, cover, and print.Quick ReferenceThese functions are built into the compiler.FunctionReturnsContextPurposeassert(cond, msg)voidsim/formal/compProve condition always holdsassume(cond, msg)voidsim/formal/compAssume condition holds (Precondition)cover(cond, msg)voidsim/formalCheck if condition is reachablecycle()voidsim/formalAdvance 1 clock cyclecycle(n)voidsim/formalAdvance N clock cyclesreset(n)voidsimHold reset for N cyclesprint(msg, ...)voidsimDebug outputUsage NotesIn Simulation: assert checks at runtime and fails the test if false. assume acts like an assert.In Formal: assert is a proof obligation. assume constrains the solver's inputs.In Components: assert documents invariants that should always be true.
